Most of the entries under ``Account settings`` are self-explanatory. Here are a few additional notes.

.. index:: Preferences; username
.. _username:

* **Username (optional).** In addition to entering your first and last name, you may specify a username. Setting your username provides much nicer URL's for shared public documents. See :ref:`vanity-urls` to learn more.

.. index:: Preferences; email address

* Your password is needed to change your **email address**.

.. index:: Preferences; unlisted

* Checking **Unlisted** will prevent your account from showing up in searches by name, for example when someone adds collaborators to a project.

.. index:: Preferences; API key

* Your password is needed to create or change the **API key** for your account. See :doc:`CoCalc API documentation <../api/index>` to learn about the API.

.. index::
   Sign out of CoCalc; from preferences
   see: Log out of CoCalc; Sign out of CoCalc

* **Sign Out of CoCalc** using one of the "Sign Out" buttons. You will be asked to confirm your selection.

.. index:: Preferences; delete account

* Clicking the **Delete Account...** button will cause a warning window to pop up. Confirmation is required before proceeding.

.. index:: Preferences; linked accounts

* Use one or more of the options under **Linked accounts** if you want to sign in with Facebook, GitHub, Google, or Twitter. You can also unlink online accounts from CoCalc in this section. To sign in with a linked account, choose the icon for Facebook, GitHub, Google, or Twitter under the blanks for Email address & Password at upper right in the sign-in screen.

   Standby Timeout
   Timeout; standby

.. _standby-timeout:

Standby timeout
----------------


If you are not active for several minutes, you may see the gray and blue CoCalc splash screen. Moving the mouse over the window or typing or clicking in the window will remove the splash screen.

.. index:: Account Tab; subscriptions and course packages
.. _subs-course-pkgs:

The time until the splash screen appears is the **standby timeout**.
We use it to conserve resources, mainly network bandwidth and browser CPU cycles. Execution of your code on the server is not paused.
You can alter the standby timeout under Account / Preferences / Other / Standby timeout, as shown above under :ref:`other-settings`.

         :align: center
         :alt: standby screen

.. note::

  After a longer interval of inactivity, your project will be stopped. Increasing this setting requires a project upgrade. See: :ref:`idle-timeout`.

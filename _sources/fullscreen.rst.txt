The Fullscreen Button
=====================

This button deserves its own page:

- Do you like to focus more on the file you are editing?
- Do you have a small screen? Perhaps when travelling?
- Do you have a huge screen? Perhaps when giving a talk?
- Do you want your new users to avoid being overwhelmed with possibilities?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above, The Fullscreen Button may just save the day! It removes the projects/files navigation bars as well as the activity bar and some system/browser elements. Click it to turn this

and click it again to go back! Alternatively, hit **Esc** (or another appropriate key for your browser) to exit the fullscreen mode of the browser, but keep CoCalc's minimized interface:

Another option to achive the same interface is to **Shift+Click** a file tab in a regular interface:

Last but not least: sometimes it is convenient to work with multiples frames, e.g. to have your table of content open, but you may want to temporarily maximize a single frame only. Click the "full frame" button:

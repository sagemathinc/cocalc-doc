Resuming a Session

Signing in Again

the same browser and computer.
All you will
generally need to do is point your browser
to https://cocalc.com and click either "Sign In" button.

You will need to sign in again if you
    * connect from a different browser or computer
    * clear your browser cookies.
    * sign out


Creating a File
---------------

Once you have opened a project, you are ready to create a file.

If your project isn't upgraded, you will get a red banner warning that your
project is running on a trial server. Ignore the warning for now and keep going.

Click **(+) New** and enter **example** where it says,
**Name your file...**.
Select **Jupyter notebook** to set the file type.
Clicking a button for the type of file causes
the file extension to be added automatically.

Your CoCalc Session
===================

.. index:: Member Hosting;compute session

CoCalc will keep track of projects you have open and files that are open within those projects.
When you return, you will see the same open projects and files.
In addition, if you have a program running and disconnect, it will keep running, with a few
exceptions: the program will stop if any of the following occurs:

* your project is on a trial server (i.e. does not have Member Hosting upgrade applied) and the server is restarted

* you do not edit a file for more than the idle time specified in **Project Settings**

* the program crashes or runs out of memory

Signing Out
-----------

You :ref:`sign out <sign-out>` by using **Account** → **Preferences** → **Sign Out...**

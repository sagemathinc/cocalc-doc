=======================
Use External Tools
=======================

Notes about using external (or 3rd party) tools on CoCalc.

Sync with Dropbox or Google Drive?
-------------------------------------------------

We do not support Google Drive at present, but we plan to.

Following the instructions at https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux you can install it in a :doc:`../terminal`.
However, Dropbox recently made a very sad decision to not support Linux (except ext4 unencrypted, which is a nonstarter), so Dropbox is no longer possible with CoCalc.



.. index:: SSHFS

Mount remote files via SSHFS
-----------------------------------

You can use ``sshfs`` as explained at :ref:`ssh-remote-files`. Note that using ``sshfs`` directly from the CoCalc terminal is not supported.

.. index:: Emacs

Use Emacs in a Terminal (Chrome)
--------------------------------------------

Chrome absolutely doesn't allow normal web applications to intercept certain keystrokes,
which makes Emacs-in-a-terminal painful on some operating systems (esp. Linux/Windows).
E.g., Ctrl-N brings up a new window, instead of going to the next line!

However, you can `install the CoCalc chrome app <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-sagemath-cloud/eocdndagganmilahaiclppjigemcinmb>`_ from the app store or on Linux,
type

::

    google-chrome --app=https://cocalc.com/app

to start the website as an "app".
(If you use chromium instead, type ``chromium-browser --app=https://cocalc.com/app``).

This is not a completely solution since in some cases,
control-shift-minus and control-shift-plus still zoom in and out
(on ChromeOS they zoom the entire desktop – every window, all icons, the time, etc., in and out!).

This is a major problem, because control-shift-minus is "undo" in emacs.
The workaround I currently use is to put this in my ``.emacs`` file,
and instead type "alt-u" for undo::

    (define-key esc-map "u" 'undo)

Note that undo is also available by default through other key bindings,
like C-x u and C-/. (Execute "M-x where-is undo".)
So there are other options available.



.. index:: FriCAS

Customized version of FriCAS
-------------------------------------

The following Sage/Python command modifies the ``PATH`` variable to include ``$HOME/bin``.
Sage looks for the ``fricas`` executable in this ``PATH``::

    os.environ['PATH'] = '%s/bin:%s'%(os.environ['HOME'],os.environ['PATH'])

Restart the Sage worksheet to make sure the new version of FriCAS is started.




.. index:: Pentadactyl plugin

Pentadactyl plugin isn't working
----------------------------------------

The `Pentadactyl plugin <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/pentadactyl/>`_ is not compatible with the `Codemirror <http://codemirror.net/>`_ editor in CoCalc.
You can disable Pentadactyl for a particular page, perhaps by pressing Control+Z.
CoCalc has it's own Vim bindings for worksheets and editing files;
to enable it, go to :doc:`../project-settings` (click the gear by your name in the upper right), then select Vim next to Editor → Bindings.

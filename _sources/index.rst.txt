What is CoCalc?
==================

Hello, and welcome to `CoCalc <https://cocalc.com/>`_,
an online platform for learning, teaching, writing, research, development - anything where you need to calculate or collaborate!

Work in CoCalc is organized in :doc:`Projects <project>` where you and your :ref:`collaborators <add-collaborators>`
can

* code in :doc:`Jupyter Notebooks <jupyter>` as well as :doc:`in R, C, Julia, and other languages <howto/software-development>`;

* edit :doc:`LaTeX <latex>`, :doc:`markdown`, and many other documents;

* have changes synchronized among all of you in real-time;

* access collaborative :doc:`terminal` and :doc:`x11`;

* :doc:`chat with your colleagues <chat>` or :ref:`LLMs <LLM_chat>`;

* use :doc:`ai` to help you fix errors, generate content, or suggest improvements;

* rely on :doc:`time-travel` to view the history of edits or to revert to a previous version;

* :doc:`publish <share>` your work letting others to build on top of it easily;

* run familiar tools including JupyterLab, :doc:`VS Code <vscode>`, Pluto, and R IDE;

* spin up a :doc:`Compute Server <compute_server>` when you need dedicated resources including multiple GPUs;

* create a :doc:`cloud_file_system` to store unlimited amount of data;

* :doc:`teach a course <teaching-instructors>` with :doc:`auto grading <teaching-nbgrader>` or run a workshop with :ref:`handouts <create-handout>`;

* contact `our dedicated team <https://cocalc.com/about/team>`_ for support and feedback!

Test It Out
-----------

To immerse yourself into CoCalc, you should

* go through the :doc:`getting-started` guide to create your account, your first project, and a worksheet;

* check out :doc:`specific guides <working_with>` for features you are most interested in;

* see how the :doc:`frame-editor` helps when working with different files;

* use it!!!


Pick a Subscription
-------------------

Initially, you start with a :doc:`Trial Project <trial>` that has quite limited compute resources and no access to the Internet to download data from other servers or install extra packages. Its purpose is to give you a sense of the interface and software environment.

To greatly improve your experience, subscribe to our `standard plan <https://cocalc.com/store/site-license>`_ or configure a custom one (you can adjust resources later at any time). If you need to test paid access as well and your organization has a complicated reimbursement process,
`contact us <https://cocalc.com/support/new?hideExtra=true&type=question&subject=Considering%20CoCalc&body=I%20want%20to%20explore%20using%20CoCalc%20for%20...&title=Let%27s%20Connect>`_
to easily get a voucher! All we ask for in return is to provide us with a feedback on your testing, in particular any blocker issues, so that we can resolve them.

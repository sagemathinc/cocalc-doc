What is CoCalc?
==================

#######################
Welcome
#######################

Hello, and welcome to `CoCalc`_,
a virtual online platform for calculations, research, collaboration and authoring documents!

The main building blocks for working in CoCalc are :doc:`Projects <project>` - separate *workspaces*
consisting of files accessible only to you and your
:ref:`collaborators <add-collaborators>`.
You and your collaborators can *edit these files at the same time*,
with changes synchronized among all of you in real-time!
Different types of files open up in their associated online editors and you start to work interactively in CoCalc's environment.
For example, files ending in ``*.sagews`` are for working with [SageMath]_ in :doc:`sagews`,
``*.ipynb`` files start CoCalc's implementations of the :doc:`Jupyter Notebook <jupyter>`,
and ``*.tex`` files open an editor for :doc:`LaTeX documents <latex>`.

Try It Out
#######################

To try out CoCalc, you might do the following steps.

* First, go through the :doc:`getting-started` guide to create your account, your first project, and a worksheet.

* Check out specific guides for  :doc:`Jupyter Notebooks <jupyter>`, :doc:`Sage Worksheets <sagews>`, and :doc:`LaTeX documents <latex>`.

* You can also work in a full :doc:`Linux Terminal <terminal>`, run :doc:`graphical applications <x11>` in a virtual desktop, or edit plain text files.

* Note how the :doc:`frame-editor` helps when working with text files, and offers syntax highlighting if you :doc:`code in C, Python, or other languages <howto/software-development>`.

* You can also :doc:`./howto/upload` accompanying some existing notebooks, data files or :doc:`LaTeX documents <./howto/overleaf>`.

* Being online and in the cloud opens opportunities to share files and collaborate. You can communicate with others in a chat room or on the side of a file. This is especially useful :doc:`in the context of teaching <teaching-interactions>` to help students.

* Check out our :doc:`Instructor Guide <teaching-instructors>` for more details about conducting a course on CoCalc.

* You can also :doc:`share your work publicly on the internet <share>`, access the entire :doc:`history of modifications for specific files <time-travel>`, :doc:`and <api/index>` :ref:`much <latex-knitr>` :doc:`more <howto/gsl>`.

* Last but not least, the company "SageMath, Inc." behind CoCalc *needs your support* to keep the service running and continuously improve it. Initially, you start with a :doc:`Trial Project <trial>` with certain restrictions â€“ most notably your project runs with lower hosting quality and has no access to the internet to download data from other servers. You can :ref:`upgrade your projects <upgrade-guide>` at any point later.

First Steps Guide
#######################

As an alternative to the steps above, you can use the **First Steps Guide**. Whenever a new project is created, a banner appears offering to create a set of files constituting the Guide:

     :alt: First Steps Guide Banner

Clicking on the banner puts copies of the Guide files into the project in a folder called ``first-steps`` and opens the file ``first-steps.task``.

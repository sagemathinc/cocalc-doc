.. index:: LaTeX Editor; Hebrew
.. _latex_with_hebrew:

Create documents in Hebrew
---------------------------------

.. _polyglossia: https://ctan.org/pkg/polyglossia?lang=en

Here are suggestions for using LaTeX in Hebrew with CoCalc:

* Change the :ref:`LaTeX build engine <latex-build-engine>` to XeLaTeX. In the "Build" pane, which appears by default at lower right when you are editing a .tex file, click the the "Engine" button and select "XeLaTeX".
* Use the polyglossia_ LaTeX package, which is already installed in CoCalc, to allow using Hebrew other language(s) in the same file. This can be useful if you wish to enter Arabic numerals.
* Use LaTeX `Noto fonts <https://www.google.com/get/noto/>`_ for Hebrew, they are already installed in CoCalc.
* Here is an example of commands you could use in the prologue of your .tex document to combine Hebrew and English::

    \usepackage{polyglossia}
    \setmainlanguage{hebrew}
    \newfontfamily{\hebrewfont}{Noto Serif Hebrew}
    \setmainfont{Noto Serif Hebrew}
    \setmainlanguage{english}
    \setmainfont{Times New Roman}

.. _nbconvert-exports:

Customize Jupyter notebook LaTeX export settings
-----------------------------------------------------

Cocalc exports Jupyter notebooks to LaTeX using `nbconvert` when "File > PDF via LaTeX" is clicked in the menu. If you want to customize the default LaTeX settings, you need to override system files found at /ext/jupyter/nbconvert/templates/latex. Instructions for creating these overrides can be found in this gist file: `custom nbconvert exports`_.

Deal with large documents across multiple source files
---------------------------------------------------------


Built-in Support for Multi-File Documents (preferred)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Native CoCalc support for multi-file documents has recently been added. Learn more about it at :ref:`multi-file-support`.


.. index:: LaTeX Editor; multi-file (legacy)

The `subfiles`_ Package (legacy method)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before direct support for multi-file documents was available, the best way was to use the `subfiles`_ package as `described here`_.
There is an extended example demonstrating how this works in the CoCalc Library.
Click "Files" and open the Library. Then select  ``Multiple source files in CoCalc`` in the ``LaTeX templates`` section.
The same example is also available at `cloud-examples/latex/multiple-files`_.

.. _described here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents#Subfiles
.. _cloud-examples/latex/multiple-files: https://github.com/sagemath/cloud-examples/tree/master/latex/multiple-files

To do this for your existing document,
let's suppose your LaTeX project is composed of one ``master.tex`` file and several ``chapter-1.tex``, ``chapter-2.tex``, etc.
CoCalc's LaTeX editor only knows about the currently opened file,
and using ``\import{}`` doesn't work, because the ``chapter-*.tex`` parts are not proper documents.

The subfiles package does not only collect the partial documents into one,
but also extracts the preamble of the ``master.tex`` file for each ``chapter-*.tex`` in order to create valid subdocuments.

Following the `subfiles documentation <http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/subfiles/subfiles.pdf>`_, do this:

1. ``\usepackage{subfiles}`` in ``master.tex``
2. ``\subfile{⟨subfile name ⟩}`` for each subfile in ``master.tex``'s ``document`` environment (i.e. instead of ``\include`` or ``\import``).
3. For each ``chapter-*.tex`` subfile::

     \documentclass[⟨master.tex file-name⟩]{subfiles}
     \begin{document}
     ⟨text, graphics, etc.⟩
     \end{document}

After that, all ``*.tex`` files can be compiled and all other features like forward/inverse search work, too.

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; Asymptote
.. index:: Asymptote

Draw using Asymptote
--------------------------------------

`Asymptote <http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/>`_ is a

    powerful descriptive vector graphics language
    that provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing.
    Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality PostScript output.

In order to tell `LatexMK`_
– which CoCalc's LaTeX editor is using by default under the hood –
to process the generated ``*.asy`` files,
you need to setup your ``~/.latexmkrc`` file in your home directory.
In order to do that, open up the ``Files`` tab in your project
and click on the home-icon to make sure you're in your home directory.
Then, click on `Create` to create a new file and enter the filename ``.latexmkrc``.
Don't overlook that leading dot in the filename, which is used for hidden files in Linux.
Then, enter these lines in the text editor and save the file::

    sub asy {return system("asy \"$_[0]\"");}
    add_cus_dep("asy","eps",0,"asy");
    add_cus_dep("asy","pdf",0,"asy");
    add_cus_dep("asy","tex",0,"asy");

These additional rules tell LatexMK to essentially run ``asy <basename>-*.asy``
on each file during the build process.
In case there are problems, you can run that command-line in a :doc:`terminal`
to see all details about any possible errors.

More information: `Asymptote LaTeX Usage <http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/doc/LaTeX-usage.html>`_.

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; Gnuplot
.. index:: LaTeX Editor; shell-escape

Enable ``shell-escape`` to plot using Gnuplot
------------------------------------------------

There are situations where the LaTeX document calls certain utilities to accomplish a task.
One example is creating plots via `Gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_ right inside the document.

For example, a snippet of tex code could look like this::

    \begin{figure}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
         \begin{axis}[ ... ]
           \addplot [...] gnuplot [raw gnuplot] {plot [-0.015:0.015] cos(380*x);};
         \end{axis}
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{figure}

In the middle, Gnuplot runs ``plot [-0.015:0.015] cos(380*x);`` to plot a cos function.

The *problem* is that by default the PDF LaTeX Engine doesn't allow to run arbitrary commands
due to security concerns. You'll see an error like that::

    Package pgfplots Error: Sorry, the gnuplot-result file 'gnuplot.pgf-plot.table'
    could not be found.
    Maybe you need to enable the shell-escape feature? [...]

.. note::

    You have to select the **PdfLaTeX (shell-escape)** engine from the selector in the
    :doc:`build panel <../frame-editor>` or modify the build command maually.

As a result, Gnuplot will be run, the error vanishes, it creates the necessary temporary files for the PGF plot, and the PDF will show the plot.
You can download the example :download:`gnuplot.tex <files/gnuplot.tex>` and see it in a screenshot below:

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; add image

Include an image
-----------------------------------------

1. Upload a PNG or PDF file via CoCalc's "Files" interface.
   The uploaded image should be in the same directory as the ``.tex`` file
   Otherwise, use relative paths like ``./images/filename.png`` if it is in a subdirectory ``images``.
2. Add ``\usepackage{graphicx}`` to the :ref:`preamble <latex-preamble>` of your file.
3. At the place where you want the image, insert a ``figure`` environment.
   Use ``includegraphics`` to include the file, with ``width`` to indicate image width, e.g. use ``0.9`` to take up 90% of document width.
4. Add ``\centering`` to have your image and caption centered in the document, and use ``caption`` to add a caption.

Here's the complete example:

.. code-block:: latex

    \usepackage{graphicx}
    ...
    \begin{document}
    ...
    \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./images/filename.png}
    \caption{here is a picture}
    \end{figure}

5. There are many more options for image placement. See for example the Wikibooks LaTeX book section on 
   `Floats, Figures and Captions <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>`_.


.. index:: LaTeX Editor; special characters

Insert a backslash or dollar sign
--------------------------------------------

The ``\`` character has a special meaning.
It signals a LaTeX command or is used as an escape character.
To enter a backslash, escape its meaning by entering it twice: ``\\``.

A dollar sign is entered as ``\$``, which escapes the meaning of "formula-start".

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; texmf
.. index:: texmf

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; install packages
.. _install-latex-packages:

Install packages in a project
---------------------------------

You can install LaTeX packages in your project:

#. Open a :doc:`terminal`
#. Check by running ``kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME`` where you can install packages locally. It should tell you ``/home/user/texmf``.
#. Create the target directory based on the name of the package. E.g. if the package is called ``webquiz``, run ``mkdir -p /home/user/texmf/tex/latex/webquiz``.
#. Change your current directory to this one via ``cd /home/user/texmf/tex/latex/webquiz``.
#. Either download the package via ``wget ...`` from CRAN and extract it via ``tar xf <downloaded tarball>`` or ``unzip ...``. Alternatively, run ``open .`` to open this path in CoCalc's file explorer and use it to :ref:`upload <upload-files>` the style files there.

In any case, all files like ``*.sty`` and ``*.cls`` in that directory will be picked up when you load that package.
You can confirm that by searching for the style file, e.g. run ``kpsewhich [name.sty]``
and you should get a location like ``/home/user/texmf/tex/latex/.../[name.sty]``.

**Note** In case you use a zip file, place it in ``/home/user/texmf`` and run ``unzip [filename.zip]`` (or if there are already files, ``unzip -o [filename.zip]`` overwrites what's there).
It should extract into the correct subdirectories, in particular ``./tex/latex`` etc.

Setup ``texmf`` in a project
------------------------------------

A CoCalc project is equivalent to a linux user account.
Therefore, the texmf discovery mechanism works the same as on a local machine.
By default, you should be able to put your own packages and styles into ``~/texmf``.

In case you just want to add a styles-file with common commands
for the `tex` processor available to all your ``.tex`` files,
you have to put them into the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/local`` sub-directory.
That way they're always found by the latex processor.
(see `stackexchange discussion <https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te>`_)

Otherwise, you might have to run run ``texhash ~/texmf`` in a terminal or the little "Terminal command" textbox in "Files".

Note: the ``~`` stands for the ``HOME`` directory, which is the root directory you see in the "Files"-listing.
You can click the home icon to jump into the home directory.
``texmf`` is a subdirectory right there.

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; spellcheck

Spell check a LaTeX document
------------------------------

Whenever you save a LaTeX document, it will run a spell checker and underline the words that are not spelled correctly.  By default, it uses the language you've set in your web browser.

You can change the autosave interval to be very short in account settings (under editor) if you need the spell checking to update frequently.

Seeing a list of alternative words (correct spellings) isn't supported directly in the editor yet `Issue #3461 <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/3461>`_.
For now, a workaround is to run LaTeX-aware ``aspell``. See :ref:`Use the aspell Linux command <use-aspell>` for details.



.. index:: LaTeX Editor; turn off build/preview

Turn off automatic build and PDF preview
---------------------------------------------

If you're working on a large LaTeX project including subfiles,
you may want to turn off compilation of the individual subfiles.

.. note::

    In general, you can open up the main file and :ref:`all subfiles will be detected <multi-file-support>`.

Here are some steps you can take:

* By default, building latex documents on saving is enabled. You can disable it under ``Account`` → ``Preferences`` → ``Editor settings`` by removing the check mark for ``Build on save: build LaTex file whenever it is saved to disk``.

* You can also disable the build process for a specific file by opening the "Build" dialog and entering ``echo`` in the line where the command is. Then it just does nothing when it tries to build.

* If you like, you could also structure your LaTeX in such a way that subdocuments also build via the `CTAN subfiles`_ package.
  You can find an example in the CoCalc Library. In a project, click on ``+ New``, and in the middle you will find the Library. Look under ``LaTeX templates`` → ``Multiple source files in CoCalc``. Then, each included file will also build on its own.


.. index:: PSTricks
.. index:: LaTeX Editor; PSTricks

Use PSTricks macros
-----------------------------------------

`PSTricks`_ is a set of macros for including PostScript drawings in a TeX document. The website has an extensive `gallery of examples`_.
The main thing to remember when using PSTricks is to set ``Engine`` in the CoCalc Build panel to ``XeLaTeX`` as in this small demo `.tex file`_ and `resulting .pdf`_.

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; embedding R/Python/Sage

Work with SageTeX, PythonTeX, or Knitr
-------------------------------------------

CoCalc supports several ways to embed code within a document.
Such code is automatically processed and evaluated during generating the document
and any output appears as part of the PDF output itself.
In particular, you can insert small calculations and formulas (Sage, SymPy, ...), Python code, R calculations, plots, data tables, etc.
This is frequently used as part of `reproducible research <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research>`_.

        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe></center>
    
Any ``.tex`` file loading the ``sagetex`` package is automatically processed via [[SageMath]].
First, Sage code is extracted into a ``.sage`` file, then ``sage ...`` evaluates that file, and finally the LaTeX engine creates the PDF document by replacing all snippets of Sage code by their evaluated result.
CoCalc handles all details for you!

To get going, you just have to insert ``\usepackage{sagetex}`` into the `preamble`_ of your document.
Calculations are done like that: ``$\frac{2}{3.5} = \sage{n(2/17)}$``, which results in |SAGETEX|.

See `SageTeX documentation <https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sagetex>`_ for more details and examples.
There is also a SageTeX example in the CoCalc Library.
Besides that, the `SageMath Documentation <http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/>`_ could also be of help!

`PythonTeX <https://ctan.org/pkg/pythontex>`_ follows the same spirit as SageTeX.
Embedded Python commands and blocks of code are extracted into a ``.py`` file,
Python 3 evaluates them,
and at the end the LaTeX engine merges the generated output snippets into the final document and renders the PDF file.
CoCalc handles all details for you!

To get going, insert ``\usepackage{pythontex}`` into the `preamble`_ of your document.
Then, you can insert inline code snippets via ``\py{}`` and blocks of code inside of ``\begin{pyblock}`` and ``\end{pyblock}``.
There is also support for [SymPy]_ code via ``\sympy{}`` or plots via Pylab using ``\pylab{}``.

For example, code like this::

    Python code: $2+3 = \py{2+3}$

    \begin{sympyblock}
    x = Symbol('x')
    f = x**2 * cos(x)
    fi = integrate(f, x)
    \end{sympyblock}

    The integral of $\sympy{f}$ is $\sympy{fi.simplify()}$

produces:

You can read more in the `PythonTeX Documentation <https://ctan.org/pkg/pythontex>`_.
Also note, that sometimes it is necessary to run "Build" again to properly re-process all code snippets.
There is also a PythonTeX example document in the CoCalc Library.

.. _preamble: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Preamble


.. index:: Knitr
.. index:: Sweave
.. _latex-knitr:

Knitr
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Knitr LaTeX documents`_ are different from SageTeX and PythonTeX.
They have their own filename extension (CoCalc supports ``.rnw`` and ``.Rtex``) and instead of calling LaTeX commands of a package, they feature their own syntax for embedded blocks and statements.
Historically, at first `Sweave`_ was added to R,
but Knitr is a much more modern variant with more features
(see `Transition from Sweave to Knitr`_). 

In general, the compilation works by first processing the input file via Knitr,
which runs R and generates a ``.tex`` document.
Then, the Latex engine processes that ``.tex`` file as usual.
CoCalc handles all details for you.

To get started, create a file ending with ``.rnw`` (Rweave/Sweave syntax) or ``.Rtex`` (code is in comment blocks).
Both will initialize the file with a template explaining you how to work with it.
For example, a block like::

    <<histogram-plot4, dev='tikz', fig.height=4, fig.width=10>>=
    data <- rnorm(1000)
    hist(data)
    @

produces a plot of a histogram, drawn using `TikZ`_.

FAQ

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; debug PDF build

The PDF cannot be built. What's the problem?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use :doc:`TimeTravel <time-travel>` to go back to a working version. In the TimeTravel view, you can use ``Changes`` to see exactly what changed between revisions.
* Another tip is to click the format button, since sometimes formatting properly can give you a good sense of what you might have messed up.
* More general, you can also use revision control like [Git]_ to track your changes. Just create a :doc:`Terminal <terminal>` file or :doc:`frame in the latex editor <frame-editor>` and go ahead and work on the command-line as usual.
* If you need more detailed help, make sure to open the ``.tex`` file and make a support request by clicking the ``Help`` button at the top right.

.. index:: LaTeX Editor; preview update

What should you do if the preview does not update?
----------------------------------------------------

Possible reasons:

1. Are there any errors in the "Issues" tab? LaTeX only compiles well if there are zero reported errors.
2. Long documents could take an extended period of time to complete. In the "Preview" tab, disable the preview and only enable it once to avoid piling up too much work on the back-end.
3. Similarly, computational-heavy "SageTeX" computations could lead to excessive compilation times.
   You can pre-compute results or split the document into smaller parts.

CoCalc OnPrem
=============

There are various reasons why the Internet based `cocalc.com <https://cocalc.com>`_ service may not be sufficient for you. You may want to make use of hardware you already own or have some requirements regarding data storage and processing location.

It is possible to run a completely standalone instance of CoCalc on a Kubernetes cluster. The underlying services and their architecture are identical to those in online cocalc.com, with comparable performance, scalability, and reliability to the online site.
See `our store <https://cocalc.com/pricing/onprem>`_ for an overview or `CoCalc OnPrem documentation <https://onprem.cocalc.com/>`_ for detailed information.


OnPrem Compute Server
---------------------

One of the hosting options when creating a :ref:`compute server <compute-servers>` is **OnPrem**. You can see how William uses his own laptop and a virtual machine running under his personal account on Lambda cloud in this video:

This approach lets you use your regular CoCalc account, collaborate with other users of the platform, and at the same time benefit from external resources you have access to!

    the project toolbar

Going from left to right:

.. index:: Project Toolbar; projects button
.. index:: Project Toolbar; project list

***************
CoCalc Logo

|cocalc-logo| Clicking on the CoCalc logo at extreme left will take you to the https://cocalc.com home page.

.. _project-list:

***************
Project List
***************

Visit https://cocalc.com/projects or click the word `Projects` to the right of the CoCalc logo to see the list of your existing projects or to create a new one. Learn more at :doc:`project-list`.


.. index:: Project Toolbar; open projects

****************
Open Projects
****************

To the right of the Projects button, tab buttons will appear for each project you have open.

     :alt: tabs for open projects occupy the middle of the project toolbar

* To the left of the project title in each button, you will see a run icon |run-icon| if the project is running, and a stop icon |stop-icon| if the project is stopped.
* To the right of the project title in each button, a red disconnect icon |disconnect-icon| will appear if the project is not connected. It is normal for the disconnect icon to appear if the project is not running.
* At the far right in each button, there is a close-project icon |remove-icon| that allows you to close the project.

A running project will continue running after it is closed until its idle timeout has been reached. At that point it will be stopped.

If you close your browser window or sign out, CoCalc will remember your open projects and files (this is your :ref:`CoCalc session <cocalc-session>`), and restore the project tabs the next time you sign in.

|wifi| The connection status icon changes color as shown below to indicate changes in the connection between your browser and CoCalc servers.

    :alt: See below for connection status icon color codes.

Colors for the connection status icon:

* Grey: connected, no messages in flight.

* Dark Blue: connected, moderate load.

* Light Blue: connected, significant load.

* Red: connected, serious message backlog.

* Orange: disconnected / connecting.


  Clicking the connection status icon brings up a window with additional connection detail, including round-trip ping time to the CoCalc servers. If the ping time doesn't appear right away, wait a bit; it's tested every 30 seconds when the window is open.

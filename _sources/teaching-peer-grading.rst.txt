Peer Grading
======================================

Use peer grading to randomly and anonymously redistribute collected assignments to your students, so that they can grade it for you.

Check **Peer Grading...** within the assignment and follow the instructions to activate this feature:

Students will get a copy of your instructions and will be able to enter grades and comments:

If students have entered single numerical grades according to the default instructions, these grades will be automatically collected and displayed on the assignment page. Their average will be entered as the default actual grade. You can easily override this grade if you wish:

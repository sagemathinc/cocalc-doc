  "intro": "## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the CoCalc API (application programming interface) is to make\nessential operations within the CoCalc platform available to automated\nclients. This allows embedding of CoCalc services within other products\nand customizing the external look and feel of the application.\n\n## Protocol and Data Format\n\nEach API command is invoked using an HTTPS PUT request.\nAll commands support request parameters in JSON format, with request header\n`Content-Type: application/json`. Many commands (those that do not\nrequire lists or objects as parameters)\nalso accept request parameters as key-value pairs, i.e.\n`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\nResponses are formatted as JSON strings.\nNote that it is possible for a request to fail and return\na response code of 200. In that case, the response\nstring may contain helpful information on the nature of\nthe failure. In other cases, if the request cannnot\nbe completed, a response code other than 200 may be\nreturned, and the response body may be a\ngeneric HTML message rather than a JSON string.\n\n## Authentication\n\nA valid API key is required on all API requests.\nTo obtain a key, log into\nCoCalc and click on Settings (gear icon next to user name at upper\nright), and look under `Account Settings`.\nWith the `API key` dialogue, you can create a key,\nview a previously assigned key, generate a replacement key,\nand delete your key entirely.\n\nYour API key carries access privileges, just like your login and password.\n__Keep it secret.__\nDo not share your API key with others or post it in publicly accessible forums.\n\n## Additional References\n\n- The [CoCalc API tutorial](https://cocalc.com/share/65f06a34-6690-407d-b95c-f51bbd5ee810/Public/README.md?viewer=share) illustrates API calls in Python.\n- The CoCalc PostgreSQL schema definition [src/smc-util/db-schema.js](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/blob/master/src/smc-util/db-schema.js) has information on tables and fields used with the API `query` request.\n- The API test suite [src/smc-hub/test/api/](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/tree/master/src/smc-hub/test/api) contains mocha unit tests for the API messages.\n- The CoCalc message definition file [src/smc-util/message.js](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/blob/master/src/smc-util/message.js) contains the source for this guide.\n\n## API Message Reference\n\nThe remainder of this guide explains the individual API endpoints.\nEach API request definition begins with the path of the\nURL used to invoke the request,\nfor example `/api/v1/change_email_address`.\nThe path name ends with the name of the request,\nfor example, `change_email_address`.\nFollowing the path is the list of options.\nAfter options are one or more sample invocations\nillustrating format of the request as made with the `curl`\ncommand, and the format of the response.\n\nThe following two options appear on all API messages\n(request parameters are often referred to\nas 'options' in the guide):\n\n- **event**: the command to be executed, for example \"ping\"\n- **id**: uuid for the API call, returned in response in most cases.\nIf id is not provided in the API message, a random id will be\ngenerated and returned in the response.",

An email query item will return\naccount id, first name, last name, and email address for the unique\naccount with that email address, if there is one. A string query item\nwill return account id, first name, and last name for all matching\naccounts.\n\nWe do not reveal email addresses of users queried by name.\n\nString query matches first and last names that start with the given string.\nIf a string query item consists of two strings separated by space,\nthe search will return accounts in which the first name begins with one\nof the two strings and the last name begins with the other.\nString and email queries may be mixed in the list for a single\nuser_search call. Searches are case-insensitive.\n\nSecurity key may be blank.\n\nNote: there is a hard limit of 50 returned items in the results.\n\nExamples:\n\nSearch for account by email.\n```\n  curl -u : \\\n    -d query=jd@m.local \\\n    https://cocalc.com/api/v1/user_search\n  ==> {\"event\":\"user_search_results\",\n       \"id\":\"3818fa50-b892-4167-b9d9-d22d521b36af\",\n       \"results\":[{\"account_id\":\"96c523b8-321e-41a3-9523-39fde95dc71d\",\n                   \"first_name\":\"John\",\n                   \"last_name\":\"Doe\",\n                   \"email_address\":\"jd@m.local\"}\n```\n\nSearch for at most 3 accounts where first and last name begin with 'foo' or 'bar'.\n```\n  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \\\n    -d 'query=foo bar'\\\n    -d limit=3 \\\n    https://cocalc.com/api/v1/user_search\n  ==> {\"event\":\"user_search_results\",\n       \"id\":\"fd9b025b-25d0-4e27-97f4-2c080bb07155\",\n       \"results\":[{\"account_id\":\"1a842a67-eed3-405d-a222-2f23a33f675e\",\n                   \"first_name\":\"foo\",\n                   \"last_name\":\"bar\"},\n                  {\"account_id\":\"0e9418a7-af6a-4004-970a-32fafe733f29\",\n                   \"first_name\":\"bar123\",\n                   \"last_name\":\"fooxyz\"},\n                  {\"account_id\":\"93f8131c-6c21-401a-897d-d4abd9c6c225\",\n                   \"first_name\":\"Foo\",\n                   \"last_name\":\"Bar\"}]}\n```\n\nThe same result as the last example above would be returned with a\nsearch string of 'bar foo'.\nA name of \"Xfoo YBar\" would not match.\n\nNote that email addresses are not returned for string search items.\n\nEmail and string search types may be mixed in a single query:\n```\n  curl -u sk_abcdefQWERTY090900000000: \\\n    -d 'query=foo bar,jd@m.local' \\\n    -d limit=4 \\\n    https://cocalc.com/api/v1/user_search\n```",

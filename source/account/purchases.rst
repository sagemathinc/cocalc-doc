Subscriptions
=========================

This section lists your currently active subscriptions and course packages.
The word "Active" denotes ordinary active subscriptions.

Note that you can "stack" multiple course plans to combine the resources. In the example above, a Small Course (25 students) and a Medium Course (70 students) are combined to provide for a class of 95 students.

.. index:: Account Tab; cancel subscription
.. index:: Cancel subscription

Personal subscriptions renew automatically. Course plans do *not* renew automatically.

**To cancel a subscription**, find the subscription in the active subscription list and click ``Cancel`` at the far right.
The subscription will not be auto-renewed at the next renewal date and the expiration date will be displayed in the subscription list.

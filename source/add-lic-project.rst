Add a License to a Project
###################################

.. note::

    If you just bought a license and want to apply your license to a project that is showing the red trial banner, then this section is for you.

    In case you don't have a license but instead quota upgrades via a subscription (older mechanism), then
    :ref:`adjust the project quotas <apply_project-upgrades>` directly.

To apply a license to a project

1. Open the project and click "Settings" (wrench icon).
2. Scroll down to the **Licenses** section.
3. Click the button marked "Upgrade using a license key...".
4. Enter your license key in the box that opens and click Save.
5. Then start or restart the project in order to activate the license.

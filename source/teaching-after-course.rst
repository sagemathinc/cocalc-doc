After the Course Ends
=====================

By default, nothing happens with the course file or students projects once the course is over. In particular, instructors and students still have access to all projects and files. However, you may want to take some actions yourself.

Remove License
--------------

If you purchased a dedicated course license that expires after the course ends, there is no harm in leaving it attached to the course. But if you are using an ongoing subscription or a license purchased for multiple terms, you may want to remove that license from completed courses. Otherwise former students may use some of the seats and not leave enough for incoming classes.

Delete Student Projects
-----------------------

Student projects may be deleted in the course file **Actions** tab with the **Delete all Student Projects...** button. You may want to do it if your do NOT want them to have access to the course materials in the future.

Student Account Access
----------------------

If students were using dedicated SSO through your institution or Google login associated to their university accounts, they may not be able to log into their accounts after graduation, i.e. when their university logins are disabled. The most reliable solution in such a situation is to download files that students want to keep, and upload them to CoCalc using "personal accounts" linked to personal emails, if desired.
